Early pre-alpha build for my first Unity game Cubulus, a synthwave-themed endless runner

Windows Installation Instructions: Download Cubulus[Version#].zip and UnityPlayer.dll to the same directory, extract Cubulus.zip to it and run Cubulus.exe

'Classic" mode is in very early stage of development and currently unplayable, 'Endless' mode is fully functional. I will be updating this often as I make more progress on it. Plan to improve UI, add more features and randomization, and try to make a more dynamic experience in the future. 

Goal: (Classic) (WARNING: UNFINISHED) Go through all the (as-of-yet uncompleted) levels! (Endless) Make it as far as you can without dying! Avoid the cubes continuously spawning or get a pill and smash them!

Controls: WASD to move, spacebar to jump, escape to pause, e to slow time (5 secs, 15 sec cooldown), f to toggle First-Person mode
Pickups: Diamonds increase speed slightly, increase health by 10, Pills make you huge, able to flatten cubes (10 second duration+.05 per extra pill consumed during effect)

current goals: expanding gameplay, Mac/Linux support
